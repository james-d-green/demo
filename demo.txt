### This is a file used to demonstrate the use of git

#1 First we must make a new directory on our local machine

#2 Then we must set our username and email using the commands: (from home directory)

# 'git config --global user.name username' and
# 'git config --global user.email email'

#3 Next we must initialise the repository using the 'git init' command

#4 The command 'git status' allows you to check the status of our repository

#5 Now we can make a new file by using the command 'touch file'

#6 Then we can add the file to the repository using 'git add file' command

#7 Commit the changes by using the 'git commit' command and add a message using '-m'

# 'git commit -m "your message"'

#8 It is always good practice to keep checking the status of the repository

#9 We can now create a remote repository on github to link to our local repository
# and copy the url of this remote repository using the green 'code' button

#10 Link the repositories using the command:

# 'git remote add origin https://your_repository_url'

#11 Push the changes that were made on your local repository onto the remote repository

#  git push origin master

#11 After editing a file use 'git status -v' to show changes
